      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings, my name is Srivatsan Sudhir. I’m 16 years old and in  11th grade. I’m currently studying in Inventure Academy in Bangalore, India. I enjoy playing chess, watching films and tv shows, and reading. I currently have an FIDE rating of 1030 in chess and have also written multiple articles and short stories for my school newspaper. I also self-published a novel in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to start writing this blog because I quite enjoy writing, and wanted a platform to put out my thoughts on things that I don’t always have a chance to, while also furthering and honing my writing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog will cover and analyze many relevant topics that interest me, from technology to different forms of media. I hope to provide a unique, well-articulated perspective on these topics that will leave you with something to think about. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
